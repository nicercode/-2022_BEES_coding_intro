### Day 3-4 Introduction to design and analysis and  linear modelling [ Eve Slavich and Gordana Popovic]

Introduction to statistics

- Which method do you use when? - Statistical inference

Linear models

- Multiple regression
- Analysis of variance (and equivalence to multiple regression)

Weirder linear models

- Blocked and paired designs - ANCOVA
- Factorial experiments
- Interactions in regression
