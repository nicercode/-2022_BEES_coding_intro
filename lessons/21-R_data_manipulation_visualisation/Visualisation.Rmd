## ggplot philosophy and intro

Fonti Kar is coming to give  a session on ggplot philosophy 

**Exercises:** In pairs, discuss a hypothesis you can address using the Sydney Beaches dataset and the plot you would like to make to demonstrate this. Try to make the plot using ggplot. In making your plot consider

- what goes on the x & y axes?
- is it one panel or many panels?
- what type of plot would be best?
- what aesthetics are you going to use: i.e. symbols, colours, etc?
- should axes be log scaled?
- is there anything else about the plot style you would change if you could?
- try saving the plot as a png and pdf using the function `ggsave`


## Extra things to consider / discuss

- ggplot vs base R graphics: 
- themes
- special axes (log)
- facets
- colours, symbols
- types of plots (incl extra packages, ggbeeswarm)
- ggsave
- ?patchwork (load via source install)
- stats: gmsmooth, lm
- plotly
