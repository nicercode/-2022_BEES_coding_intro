# A quick demo of some things you can do

(Dan, 9:30-10:00)

What is R

- R consists of writing code
- Why write code?
  - reproducible - love not to your future self
- Code vs console
- Different clients -- Rstudio

Demonstration of data analysis -- using the Sydney Beaches dataset

- see the file Intro_demo.Rmd

#  The Rstudio environment 

(Will, 10:00-10:30)

Rstudio 

- into to panels panels

Writing code

- Code vs console vs Rmd
- Rmarkdown (code chunks, markdown)

Packages


- Install package by using `install.packages("package-name")`
- Update packages by using `update.packages("package-name")`
- Load packages by using `library("package-name")`
- tidyverse is a useful collection of packages
- Possible to install packages from places other than cran (e.g. github, r-forge, local computer)
  - ways to install

**Exercises:** Install R (>3.5), Rstudio (1.1.463), and the `tidyverse` packages

Good instructions [here if needed](https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/#setup_instructions)

# Doing a full analysis yourself

```{r}
?read_csv

```
(Will, 10:30-11:00)

**Exercises:** Download course materials and knit demo. Go to the folder `lessons/10-R_intro/` and open the file `Intro_demo.Rmd` Make sure everyone can knit the demo. Take time to fix any issues that arise.
  
# Morning tea

(11:00-11:30)

# Assigning objects

(Dan, 11:30-12:00)

Code vs console vs Rmd

Use `<-` to assign something as an object in memory

- use `ls()` to see what's available in your environment 
- Rstudio environment panel
- Take errors seriously 

Running code vs assigning object

```{r}
12    # doesn't print anything
snakes <- 12
(snakes <- 12)  # but putting parenthesis around the call prints the value of `weight_kg`
snakes          # and so does typing the name of the object
```

<- vs = (outside vs inside function calls)
-> vs <- (-> works more naturally)

use `rm()` to delete objects

Style

- the [tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/)
  - likes `_` between names
  - variable and function names should use only lowercase letters, numbers, and `_`. Use underscores (`_`) (so called snake case) to separate words within a name, e.g. `day_one`

**Exercises:**

1. Make a new variable containing the number 13
2. Make a new variable 1345 times the variable above (doing the calculation in code)
3. Make new variables containing the name of you and your partner

# Loading data

(Dan, 12:00-12:30)

Where might you need to load data from (consider both sources and file types)? (Discuss with partner)

Tables are a special type

- tidy data: 1 observation per row, 1 variable per column

Comma Separated Files (csv) files are a common and desirable format. Why?

How do they work?

Use `read_csv` to load csv file

- intro to a function
- key arguments
- options for parsing 
- Loaded data need to be assigned as objects
- `read_csv` (in the tidyverse) is generally better than `read.csv`

**Exercises:**

1. Load the file `10-R_intro/data/sydneybeaches.csv` into R and save as a variable called `data_beaches`
2. Create a csv file from either Excel or Google Sheets
3. Open your csv file in the Rstudio editor (or another text editor)

```{r}
x <- TRUE
class(x)
```



**Resources:**

You can likely load most data types into R

A few resources for loading other file types

- [readxl](https://readxl.tidyverse.org/reference/read_excel.html): Reading data direct from Excel
- [datapasta](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/datapasta/): when copying and pasting data from the web
- [googlesheets4](https://googlesheets4.tidyverse.org/): for reading data from google sheets

# Lunch 

(12:30 - 13:30)

# Object types I

(Will, 13:30-14:30)

- data frame
   - columns
   - $
- vector
   - []
   - :
- data types
  - character
  - integer
  - numeric
  - boolean
  - dates
- variables
- matrix
- lists
  - non-table structures
  - calling via names, numbers




**Exercises:**

create a new column in the data_beaches data frame and change the units of Enterococci from cfu_per100ml to Enterococci_cfu_per_10ml

the Enterococci_cfu_per_100ml variable to Enterococci_cfu_per_10ml

```{r}
data_beaches <- read_csv("data/sydneybeaches.csv")
dim(data_beaches)

data_beaches[,1:3]
sort(unique(data_beaches$Site),decreasing = TRUE)
```
# Exploring data: useful vocabulary

(Dan, 14:30-15:00)

We're now going to check out a bunch of really useful R functions and see how they work, to explore some data in the "Sydney Beaches" data set. 

First load the data from `data/sydneybeaches.csv` and save as `data_beaches`


To look at columns of numeric data, these functions can be helpful:

- min, max, range, sum, length, mean, sd

To look at columns of categorical data, these functions can be helpful:

- unique, sort, length

These functions can be used on whole dataframes

- nrow
- dim
- colSum, rowSum

**Exercises:**

1. Load the beaches data, then 
  - extract the column `Enterococci_cfu_per_100ml` and save as a new variable
  - find the min and max count
  - find the mean
  - find the mean of the first 100 records
2. Using the same data, extract the column `Site` and save as a new variable
  - find all unique values
  - find all unique values and sort them
3. using the whole dataframe
  - How many rows and columns does it have
  - Make a new dataset using only the first 10 rows
  - Make a new dataset using only the first 3 columns

# Afternoon tea

(15:00 - 15:30)

# More complicated functions and how to use them 

(Dan. 15:30-16:00)

Investigate function structure, using the function `lm` as an example

- function structure
  - name
  - body
  - arguments
- investigating structure of function f 
  - `args(f)`
  - `body(f)` or just `f`
  - return value
- ?help
- named vs ordered arguments
- default arguments

```{r}
model_fit<-lm(iris$Sepal.Length~iris$Petal.Length)
```



# Q & A
