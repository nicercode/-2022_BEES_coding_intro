Motivation

- Life is complicated, and I used to be in pain, but now I live a blissful peaceful happy existence with no worries aside from feeding unicorns.
- Top tip for happy coding
	- structure for organising yourself
	- not only way you can do it, but unless have other good ideas, consider adopting it
- Most people tend to organize their projects like this:

A good project layout will ultimately make your life easier:

* It will help ensure the integrity of your data;
* It makes it simpler to share your code with someone else
(a lab-mate, collaborator, or supervisor);
* It allows you to easily upload your code with your manuscript submission;
* It makes it easier to pick the project back up after a break.


Path names

- You have to know where things are
- Where on your computer: `getwd()`
- What's in the folder: `dir()` 
- Absolute versus relative paths
	- Person 1: Describe how to get to level 5 of this building
	- Person 2: Describe how to get to level 5 of this building, from the entrance to the uni on Anzac parade

**Exercises:**

1. Use the `getwd` to find the absolute path of the `folder`

2. Use the `dir` function to list contents of the folder you are in
	- change one of the default arguments to return the full path name of the files

3. Check a file exists using both absolute and relative paths, using the `file.exists` function


How do we organise materials?

- What is a meaningful unit for project? (A chapter or analysis)
	- **Happy coder rule**: Projects are distinct & self contained
	- start with a folder for project

- Key parts: What sort of files do we have to deal with?
	- README.md -- orients
	- data/
	- analysis.Rmd
	- R/
	- output/

-	Path names:
	- **Happy coder rule**: use relative paths
		1. can move projects around and still use it
		2. collaboration

- Rstudio project files
	- opening projects
	- **Happy coder rule**: use Rstduio's project files
	- **Rule: never use setwd**
	- [Hadley Wickham on opening Rstudio projects](https://youtu.be/boKFxBniUH0) 

- More guidelines:
	- use a consistent project structure
	- everything in `data` should be read-only (and precious)
	- everything in the folder `R` is a code for a function
	- everything in `output` is disposable
	- main R or Rmd script is simple and readable
	- all Rmd files written to run from the top directory
	- Use a file `readme.md` to give brief introduction
		- might add another in the directory `data`

**Exercises:**

1. Create a new project layout for one of your projects:

- Start in a new folder (In Rstudio go to `File` -> `New Project`, then choose `New directory`)
- Add an Rmd file like `Analysis.Rmd`
- Create a folder called `data` and add a csv file to the folder 
- Try closing and reopening Rstudio, switching between different projects. Use `getwd()` to see what folder you're in and `ls()` to see what's in memory
