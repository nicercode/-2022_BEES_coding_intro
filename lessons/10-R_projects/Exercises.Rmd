## Motivation

**Happy coder rule**: Managing your projects in a reproducible fashion doesn't just make your science reproducible, it makes your life easier. [@vsbuffalo](https://twitter.com/vsbuffalo/status/323638476153167872)

Managing all the "stuff" in research is hard. But I live a blissful peaceful happy existence with no worries (aside from feeding unicorns). That's because i use tested strategies for staying organised.

Most people tend to organize their projects like this:

This is not a good strategy.

A good project layout will ultimately make your life easier:

* It will help ensure the integrity of your data;
* It makes it simpler to share your code with someone else
(a lab-mate, collaborator, or supervisor);
* It allows you to easily upload your code with your manuscript submission;
* It makes it easier to pick the project back up after a break.

## Finding files & R's working directory

Sanity starts with undersatding where R operating and what it can access.

R works from the "working directory" -- the folder where it is currently located. 

**Exercises:**

1. Use the `getwd` to find the absolute path of the `folder`

```{r}
getwd()
```

2. Use the `dir` function to list contents of the folder you are in

```{r}
dir()
```

3. Data not loading? Checking whether a file "exists" is a good way to check if R is pointing at the right spot. 

```{r}
filename <- "zz"
file.exists(filename)
```

## A meaningful unit for organisation

**Happy coder rule**: Projects are distinct & self contained

A sensible "project" should contain all the "stuff" you need to execute your research.  
At what scale (week, chapter, PhD, career) should we organise our materials? 

**Discuss**: What is a meaningful unit for project?

## Rstudio project files make life easier

**Happy coder rules**: use Rstudio's project files, never use `setwd`

**Exercises:**

1. Open the project for this lesson, by selecting "R-projects.Rproj". Note you are now in a project.

2. What is the root of your project as an absolute pathname

```{r}
getwd()
```

3. By clicking on the project icon in the top right of screen, open a project for the next lesson "R-data_manipulation.Proj". Check the working directory:

```{r}
getwd()
```

4. Again, using the project icon in the top right of screen, try switching between projects. The working directory and files should change.

## Path names 

**Happy coder rules**: use relative paths, from project `root`. Never use absolute paths.


Absolute versus relative paths

- Person 1: Describe how to get to level 5 of this building, from level 1 (relative path, from level 1)
- Person 2: Describe how to get to level 5 of this building, starting with lattidue and longitude (absolute path)

**Exercises:**

1. Try reading in the data file in the folder `data`, using a full path

```{r}
full_path <- file.path(getwd(), "data/plantHeightSingleSpp.csv")

data <- read.csv(full_path)
```

Now try with relative path

```{r}
data <- read.csv("data/plantHeightSingleSpp.csv")
```

Note, if you operate from the project root, you can use relative paths for everything. This means

- pathnames don't break when you move the project around
- code will also run on other machines, including collaborators.

## Within your projects, use a consistent folder structure

**Happy coder rules**: use a prediatble and intuitaive folder structure

"Where are the forks?"

**Discuss**: What are the key parts of a project (i.e. file types and activties)

- everything in `data` should be read-only (and precious)
- everything in the folder `R` is a code for a function
- everything in `output` is disposable
- main R or Rmd script is simple and readable
- all Rmd files written to run from the top directory
- Use a file `readme.md` to give brief introduction
- might add another in the directory `data`

**Exercises:**

1. Create a new project layout for one of your projects:

- Start in a new folder (In Rstudio go to `File` -> `New Project`, then choose `New directory`)
- Add an Rmd file like `Analysis.Rmd`
- Create a folder called `data` and add a csv file to the folder 
- Try closing and reopening Rstudio, switching between different projects. Use `getwd()` to see what folder you're in and `ls()` to see what's in memory
